## Local development

2. The project requires Node and npm for development
3. Install dependencies from the root directory `npm install`
4. Start the TypeScript and Vite development servers together by running `npm run dev` from the root directory.

## Conventions

- Casing - try to match built-in JS methods/casing whenever possible
  - Variables including constants are camelCase
  - Classes and types are PascalCase
  - File names are kebab-case
- Prefer arrow functions over the `function` keyword.
