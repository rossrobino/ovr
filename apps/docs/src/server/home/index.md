A [lightweight](https://npmgraph.js.org/?q=ovr) server framework built for streaming HTML with asynchronous generator JSX.

## Introduction

Designed to optimize performance and Time-To-First-Byte, ovr evaluates components in parallel and streams HTML in order by producing an [`AsyncGenerator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncGenerator) of HTML that feeds directly into the streamed response.

For the following component:

```tsx
function Component() {
	return <p>hello world</p>;
}
```

ovr generates three `Chunk`s of HTML:

```ts
"<p>"; // streamed immediately
"hello world"; // next
"</p>"; // last
```

## Asynchronous streaming

While this streaming is trivial for a paragraph, consider when a component is asynchronous:

```tsx
async function Username() {
	const user = await getUser(); // slow...

	return <span>{user.name}</span>;
}

function Component() {
	return (
		<p>
			hello <Username />
		</p>
	);
}
```

Instead of waiting for `Username` to resolve before sending the entire `Component`, ovr will send what it has immediately and stream the rest as it becomes available.

```ts
"<p>";
"hello ";
// streamed immediately

// for await (const chunk of Username()) { ...
"<span>";
"username";
"</span>";
"</p>";
```

## Render how browsers read

Web browsers are [built for streaming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/How_browsers_work#parsing), they parse and paint HTML as it arrives. [Most critically, the head](https://web.dev/learn/performance/understanding-the-critical-path#what_resources_are_on_the_critical_rendering_path) of the document can be sent immediately to start the requests for linked assets (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) and start parsing before the HTML has finished streaming.

ovr's architecture gives you streaming server-side rendering out of the box. No hydration bundle, no buffering---just HTML delivered _in order_, as soon as it's ready.
